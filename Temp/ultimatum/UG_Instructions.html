<p>In each round, you are randomly paired with another anonymous participant.</p>
<p>One of you is randomly chosen as the <strong>Proposer</strong>, the other as the <strong>Responder</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The group receives <strong>10 points</strong> to split.</li>
  <li>The Proposer chooses how many of the 10 points to offer to the Responder.</li>
